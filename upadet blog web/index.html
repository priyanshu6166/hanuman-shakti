        The story of Hanuman's birth begins with his divine parents: Kesari, a mighty monkey king, and Anjana, a celestial nymph, both of whom were blessed by various gods. However, there’s a divine connection that made Hanuman Ji’s birth extraordinary Anjana, who was once a celestial nymph, had been cursed and turned into a monkey. She longed for a child and prayed fervently to the gods to bless her with a son who would possess immense strength and wisdom. The divine couple, Lord Vayu (the Wind God) and Anjana, meditated and prayed with deep devotion for many years
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Lord Shiva was pleased with their devotion and granted a boon. He blessed Anjana with a child who would be no ordinary child. He would be born with the powers of Lord Shiva himself. This child would possess incredible strength, wisdom, and be capable of extraordinary feats, marking him as a force to be reckoned with in the worldLord Vayu’s Blessing and Lord Indra’s Role Once Anjana became pregnant, the wind god Vayu also blessed her, bringing strength to the child. In some versions of the myth, Lord Vayu is said to have carried a part of Lord Shiva’s divine energy to Anjana, who thus became pregnant with a child who was no less than divine
        At the same time, Lord Indra, the king of the gods, also played a role. He gifted Anjana's unborn child with an immense and irresistible power that could move mountains and defeat evil. Indra's thunderbolt, the Vajra, would later be used to test the strength of Hanuman Ji

    Finally, after a long period of devotion, Anjana gave birth to a beautiful, powerful child—Hanuman. As soon as Hanuman Ji was born, he exhibited extraordinary abilities. He could immediately fly and even display enormous strength. It is said that as a child, Hanuman once mistook the sun for a fruit and attempted to fly towards it, such was his incredible powerAs Hanuman flew toward the sun, Lord Indra, fearing that the child’s powers might be too much to handle, struck him with his thunderbolt. This caused Hanuman to fall back to Earth, unconscious, and this is where Hanuman Ji’s divine connection with Lord Shiva comes into playAfter Lord Indra's action, Hanuman Ji's mother, Anjana, was heartbroken. However, the gods soon realized the immense potential and divinity within Hanuman Ji and decided to bless him in a way that would elevate his powers even furtherLord Brahma (the creator god) came forward and granted Hanuman Ji immortality and a divine intellect. Lord Shiva, pleased with Hanuman’s devotion, bestowed upon him divine knowledge and the ability to change his form at will, making him invincible
    <br><br>
    Lord Vishnu, recognizing Hanuman Ji’s loyalty and potential, also blessed him with the boon of eternal strength and agility, and promised that Hanuman would be a great devotee and protector of Lord Rama.

        birthDesc: "हनुमान जी का जन्म केवल रोमांचक ही नहीं बल्कि दिव्य चमत्कारों, भक्ति और देवताओं की कृपा से भरपूर है। हनुमान जी हिंदू धर्म के सबसे प्रिय देवताओं में से एक हैं, जो अपनी अपार शक्ति, बुद्धिमत्ता, भगवान राम के प्रति भक्ति और रामायण महाकाव्य में उनके सर्वोच्च देवता के रूप में भूमिका के लिए प्रसिद्ध हैं। हनुमान जी का जन्म मिथक में गहरे रूप से निहित है और इसमें दिव्य आशीर्वादों, आकाशीय घटनाओं की एक श्रृंखला और शक्तिशाली देवताओं का मिश्रण है।",
        parentsHeading: "हनुमान जी के दिव्य माता-पिता",
        parentsDesc: " हनुमान जी का जन्म एक दिव्य कथा से शुरू होता है, जिसमें उनके दिव्य माता-पिता हैं: केसरी, एक महान वानर राजा, और अंजना, एक स्वर्गीय अप्सरा, जिन्हें विभिन्न देवताओं द्वारा आशीर्वाद प्राप्त था। हालांकि, हनुमान जी का जन्म अद्वितीय और विशेष बनाता है एक दिव्य संबंध। अंजना, जो पहले एक स्वर्गीय अप्सरा थीं, शापित हो गई थीं और एक वानर में बदल गई थीं। उन्हें एक संतान की अत्यंत इच्छा थी और उन्होंने देवताओं से प्रार्थना की कि उन्हें ऐसा पुत्र प्राप्त हो, जिसमें अपार शक्ति और बुद्धिमत्ता हो। भगवान वायु (पवन देवता) और अंजना ने कई वर्षों तक गहरी भक्ति के साथ ध्यान और प्रार्थना की।भगवान शिव उनके भक्ति से प्रसन्न हुए और उन्होंने आशीर्वाद दिया। उन्होंने अंजना को एक ऐसे पुत्र का आशीर्वाद दिया जो कोई सामान्य बच्चा नहीं होगा। वह भगवान शिव की शक्तियों के साथ जन्म लेगा। इस पुत्र में अद्भुत शक्ति, बुद्धिमत्ता होगी, और वह असाधारण कार्यों को करने में सक्षम होगा, जिससे वह दुनिया में एक महान शक्ति के रूप में जाना जाएगा।भगवान वायु का आशीर्वाद और भगवान इंद्र की भूमिकाएक बार जब अंजना गर्भवती हुईं, तो पवन देवता वायु ने भी उन्हें आशीर्वाद दिया, जिससे बच्चे को शक्ति मिली। कुछ संस्करणों में यह कहा जाता है कि भगवान वायु ने भगवान शिव की दिव्य ऊर्जा का एक अंश अंजना तक पहुँचाया, जिससे वह गर्भवती हुईं और उनका बच्चा पूरी तरह से दिव्य था।साथ ही, भगवान इंद्र, देवताओं के राजा, ने भी एक भूमिका निभाई। उन्होंने अंजना के अजन्मे बच्चे को अपार और अप्रतिरोध्य शक्ति दी, जिससे वह पर्वतों को हिला सकता था और बुराई को हराने में सक्षम था। इंद्र का वज्र (बिजली) बाद में हनुमान जी की शक्ति की परीक्षा लेने के लिए उपयोग किया गया।",

        parentsdesc2: "  अंततः, लंबे समय तक भक्ति के बाद, अंजना ने एक सुंदर और शक्तिशाली संतान को जन्म दिया—हनुमान। जैसे ही हनुमान जी का जन्म हुआ, उन्होंने असाधारण क्षमताओं का प्रदर्शन किया। वह तुरंत उड़ सकते थे और अत्यधिक शक्ति का प्रदर्शन कर सकते थे। कहा जाता है कि बचपन में हनुमान ने एक बार सूर्य को फल समझकर उसकी ओर उड़ान भरने की कोशिश की, यह उनकी अद्भुत शक्ति का प्रमाण था।जब हनुमान सूर्य की ओर उड़ रहे थे, भगवान इंद्र ने यह सोचते हुए कि बच्चे की शक्तियाँ बहुत अधिक हो सकती हैं, उन्हें अपने वज्र से मारा। इस कारण हनुमान पृथ्वी पर गिरकर बेहोश हो गए, और यहीं पर हनुमान जी का भगवान शिव से दिव्य संबंध प्रकट हुआ।भगवान इंद्र की क्रिया के बाद, हनुमान जी की माता अंजना अत्यंत दुखी हो गईं। लेकिन देवताओं ने जल्द ही हनुमान जी में छुपी अपार क्षमता और दिव्यता को पहचाना और उन्हें ऐसे आशीर्वाद देने का निर्णय लिया जिससे उनकी शक्तियाँ और भी बढ़ सकें। भगवान ब्रह्मा (सृष्टिकर्ता देवता) ने आगे बढ़कर हनुमान जी को अमरता और दिव्य बौद्धिकता का आशीर्वाद दिया। भगवान शिव, हनुमान जी की भक्ति से प्रसन्न होकर, उन्हें दिव्य ज्ञान और अपनी इच्छानुसार रूप बदलने की क्षमता से नवाजे, जिससे वे अजेय बन गए भगवान विष्णु ने हनुमान जी की निष्ठा और क्षमता को पहचानते हुए उन्हें शाश्वत शक्ति और लचीलापन का आशीर्वाद दिया, और यह वादा किया कि हनुमान जी भगवान राम के महान भक्त और रक्षक बनेंगे।हनुमान जी के जन्म का महत्वहनुमान जी का जन्म एक दिव्य घटना के रूप में देखा जाता है, जो अच्छाई के लिए अपार क्षमता लेकर आया। बचपन से ही हनुमान जी ने अपार शक्ति, बुद्धिमत्ता, भक्ति और धर्म के प्रति अडिग समर्पण जैसी अद्भुत विशेषताएँ प्रदर्शित कीं। उनका जन्म एक रक्षक के रूप में हुआ था, जो बाद में भगवान राम के सबसे महान भक्तों में से एक बनेंगे और रामायण में केंद्रीय पात्र के रूप में उभरेंगे, जो भगवान राम के जीवन और संघर्षों को वर्णित करने वाली प्राचीन महाकाव्य है।हनुमान जी के आशीर्वादहनुमान जी की जन्मकथा यह दर्शाती है कि वह एक दिव्य उद्देश्य के लिए जन्मे थे—भगवान राम की सेवा करने, बुराई के बलों से लड़ने और अच्छाई की रक्षा करने के लिए। उनकी अपार शक्तियाँ कई देवताओं के आशीर्वाद का परिणाम थीं, और एक दिव्य रक्षक के रूप में उनकी भूमिका हिंदू पुरानी कथाओं में एक महत्वपूर्ण विषय रही है।"
